shell scripting practice to take numeric inputs and perform intended operations

This started out as subtract.sh which would take two numbers from user input
and pass them into variables to subtract num2 from num1. I added addition
functionality and division functionality, and ran into some difficulty with
correctly using git. The subtract repository has been deleted, and the code has
been copied to math.sh to create a new repository.

As of the time of writing, the division function only returns integers or floats
with 13 decimal spaces.

This is meant to be a shell scripting learning exercise. If there is something
useful for you, you are free to copy and paste and modify any section of code.
