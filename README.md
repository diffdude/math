#math \n

Math.sh and mathd.sh are a shell script to take numeric inputs and
perform intended operations

This started out as subtract.sh, which would take two numbers from user
input and pass them into variables to subtract num2 from num1. I added
addition and division functionality, and ran into some difficulty with
correctly using git, which led to a new name and new repository.

So far, the script asks for user intent: add, subtract, multiply, divide
or exponent. For each intent, the script will take two numeric inputs.

This is meant to be a shell scripting learning exercise. If there is
something useful for you here, you are free to copy, paste, fork, clone
and modify any section of code.
